    The man in the high window looks out over the city and contemplates his
    existence. 35 stories up he can see everything that is relevant to him,
    sprawled out like an atlas. Fog obscures the mountains in the distance. The
    damp wind buffets the window, shaking it a bit. Inside is still.
  </p>

  <p>
    The man’s eyes are the same gray as the fog, and equally impenetrable. His
    suit also gray, his tie gray, his socks (gray shoes discarded somewhere else
    in the apartment) gray. Everything gray. As is the inside of the apartment.
    Gray couch on a gray rug. Gray walls holding a large art piece of minimalist
    design: gray speckled background and a shock of red shot across like blood.
  </p>

  <p>
    The apartment hums with the industry of idle appliances. The refrigerator
    sighs. Behind some closed door the washing machine struggles. The wifi
    router spits data into the air, beeping occasionally to signal its continued
    commitment to the task.
  </p>

  <p>
    The man looks down at the pavement 400 feet below. Vertigo blanks his mind,
    and for a moment he experiences the entire precipitous drop as vividly as a
    dream. His gut does a flip, and he relishes the sensation.
  </p>

  <p>Inside a voice: “Dad?”</p>

  <p>
    He turns but the apartment is empty. Wednesday’s she’s with her mother, he
    reminds himself.
  </p>

  <p>
    He looks back out the window to try and triangulate their location. It’s
    near 6 so they’re probably at home preparing dinner together. Her
    neighborhood is on the other side of the highway there, he knows that, but
    he’s never seen the actual house. Doesn’t even know the address.
    Pick-up/drop-off is handled “asynchronously” by way of school: on his week
    he picks her up Monday afternoon, and drops her off the following Monday
    morning. The school day is used as a buffer so their paths never cross.
  </p>

  <p>
    He scans the distant streets hoping to catch them hurrying home from a
    last-minute grocery run. It’s pointless. Even without the fog and
    diminishing light human bodies only look like vague specks from up here. For
    a moment his mind goes to the expensive telescope on the balcony, but he
    quickly discards the thought.
  </p>

  <p>
    The phone in his pocket buzzes. Dinner. They want him to come downstairs to
    grab it. Idiot, he thinks, I told them to leave it at the desk. He
    communicates his frustration in a flurry of texts, but the delivery person
    doesn’t budge. Company policy, they say.
  </p>

  <p>
    Temperature rising, the man drags himself to the bedroom to look for
    slippers. His closet is immaculate. Each shirt and trouser is crisply hung,
    arranged by color from light gray to dark gray. The shoes also lay in a neat
    row, but there’s a gap where the slippers should be.
  </p>

  <p>
    Out by the bed he empties his pockets and lowers his belly to the floor.
    Peering under the frame he notices a pair of slippers lying haphazardly. He
    pulls them out, revealing their tiny pinkness. The toes are adorned each
    with a poofy white flower.
  </p>

  <p>
    His mind is yanked to some morning last week. A flurry of scattered
    homework, burnt toast, shower puddle that somehow makes its way to the
    living room, brown paper bag filled at the last minute with dammit I guess I
    have some crackers and a string cheese. It was pajama day at school. “Dad,
    where are my slippers?” Where the hell are they? No time to look. “Just take
    mine, honey.”
  </p>

  <p>
    He considers the tiny slippers in his hand, half the size of his feet. His
    stomach growls and his head pounds. He throws the shoes on the bed and
    storms out in his socks, the front door slamming itself behind him.
  </p>

  <p>
    The shared hallway is a mausoleum in the silence that follows. 14 identical
    doors stretch out in either direction. Not even a whimsical doormat breaks
    the monotonous gray carpet. The man is grateful for its emptiness. For some
    reason it feels illegal to be out here shoeless.
  </p>

  <p>
    He slinks towards the elevator at the end of the hallway, trying to control
    his breathing. Stoicism is paramount in this building; one must never let
    their emotions spill past the confines of their own apartment, tainting the
    public space.
  </p>

  <p>
    The elevator takes an eternity to rise to the 35th floor. It finally dings
    its arrival, and the man waits in apprehension for the doors to slowly part,
    hoping to avoid any kind of neighborly interaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    He slips inside the empty cage and hammers the Lobby button. The elevator is
    unconcerned with his anxiety, and waits diligently for any straggling
    passengers. After a few excruciating seconds, the doors slide shut.
  </p>

  <p>The machine shudders, and begins its 35-story descent.</p>

  <p>
    In his socks, the man contemplates his dinner. He thinks of all the ways he
    could admonish the delivery person for their job poorly done. He starts to
    think of his own job, his promotion surely on the horizon. He wants it more
    than anything, he has been putting in the long hours. He thinks of a note to
    send his boss and reaches for his phone, but his pocket is empty. In his
    mind, he sees it in a pile on his bed, next to his keys and the tiny pink
    slippers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The elevator jolts, throwing the man off balance. He reflexively puts his
    hand against the wall, feeling its hum. The sound intensifies, as if
    struggling against something. There is a loud groan. The machine gulps,
    swallows, and drops.
