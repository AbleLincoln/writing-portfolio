Listen! Do you hear that?
Music in the living room
and laughter
Adult voices thick
as chocolate fondue melt up the stairs
blanketing us with gooey sweetness.

Smell the complex
tang of potluck
earthy chili mingles with putrid
brussel sprouts –
a spread you would never eat
but still would love to see –
and above it all wafts the sting
of alcohol: gin, tonic water,
and lime burning
our eyes and tickling
our throats.

Lay your head on the bannister
so the stomping of feet and the
patting of backs
reverberates
through the architecture
into your heart.
