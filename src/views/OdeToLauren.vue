Oh Lauren
Softness of skin, hair, and eyes.
Your face like a light.
Not one of those harsh overhead lights,
But a warm lamp
I found in the antique store
And just knew I had to take home with me
And place it in my living room
So I could admire it every morning.
Your hair the lampshade, perfectly fit
Framing your beautiful glow.
Your eyes the filament 
where burns the source of your radiance.
From that pours your intelligence, 
your humor
That brightens everything
So I see the world in a new light.
