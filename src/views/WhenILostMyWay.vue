When I lost my way
I was leaving the house to run a quick errand.
I must have left it in the ceramic dish by the door
shaped like a turnip
full of useless artifacts. I can
picture my way nestled
next to the box of matches
from that Italian restaurant where we used to
eat expensive spaghetti and drink 
cheap wine.
I had my way, then.
I remember the heft of it
in my pocket
as we walked back from the beach
in the shimmering dusk.
Or maybe it’s under the bed.
I recall something slipping
off the sheets the last time
we made love 
I didn’t want to say anything
to spoil the mood
but
that must have been my way.
I can see it now
fraternizing with the dust bunnies.
When I get home I’ll
stick my arm behind the frame
and fish it out
hoping
I don’t dredge an old boot
you left behind
