The Crown of Seeds atop my head
Split open
To make undead
Some ancient knowledge yet unread.

Upon the heath I cast my spell
Among the ash and 
Chaparral.
How can Heaven begot of Hell?

Can angels sing where demons spit?
I raise my staff to cleave the grit
and fertilize
Their toxic shit.

The waste resists my fervent blows.
Its synthetic substance 
snorts and glows
As acrid vapors burn my nose.

I drive my hand into the earth
And snuff the heat of demons’ mirth
To prepare the place for our rebirth.

When the soil’s cool and mild
I let the earth subsume my hand
And whisper her my secret plan.

With each word I gently lay
A seed inside the rock and clay.

The painful part now complete
The three of us
Loudly weep.
The earth, the sky, and I.
